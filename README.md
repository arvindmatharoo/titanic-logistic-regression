# Titanic Survival Prediction - Logistic Regression 
Predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using Logistic Regression.

## Project Overview 
This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that oredicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck or not.
It is a classic binary classification problem and an excellent exercise for applying Logistic Regression and understanding data preprocessing techniques.
In this project, I also used **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the mmodel's performance 

## Objectives 
- Explore and visualize the dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Engineer relevent features
- Build and Train a Logistic Regression model
- Tune hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**
- Evaluate model performance

## Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Dataset 

-[Kaggle Titanic Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
